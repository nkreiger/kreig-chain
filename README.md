#Route the blockchain-approved reward transactions through its own dedicated server. That way, not everyone can create transactions through the special blockchain wallet.
#An implementation where the Minerâ€™s mine() function only grabs a group of the transactions, and not the entire pool. When the subset of transactions from the pool is included in the chain, they would need to be cleared from the pool, and synchronized across all miners.
